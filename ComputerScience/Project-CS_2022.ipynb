      "Keva, here and IÃ¢ÂÂm ready to conquer the world! I just need a special human/s to accompany me on this mission. I am a 3 year old bulldog mix, who gained all of the bulldog stubbornness. But, with consistency and structure, I am learning that I can let go of that, a little. I love people and anyone who will give me attention. I love other dogs....perhaps too much....I want to play and I donÃ¢ÂÂt take no for an answer, so other dogs donÃ¢ÂÂt like me so much.

      "Meet the very pretty Billie!  This 1 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback/ Cur mix gal wandered up to a barn starving and looking for friends.

Billie gets along wonderfully with the other dogs in the foster home.  She loves to cuddle up and watch Netflix, as well as snuggle.  Billie is a very smart girl, and is already housetrained. She even smiles at her foster mom when she comes home from work and says hi to her.  She circles around her with the biggest smile.  Billie would make the perfect addition to any household.

Now I live with my foster family and I am learning my way as a family dog. I would do best in a home with another dog who can show me the ropes. When I'm not playing with my doggie friends I enjoy rolling around in the grass, getting the zoomies, playing with stuffed animals and laying on a nice warm bed/couch. I have lived with little people too, though it can take me awhile to adjust.

He is great on a leash and can go for a great 3 mile walk that he monitors at whatever pace you want. He is a champ as a companion and he loves to meet new people and their dogs on the hiking trails. What a perfect boy he truly is! He wants you to be around him as much as possible. A fenced yard is a good idea but don't leave him out there alone. He is not happy alone at all. He loves for you to take him to dog parks so he can be a social butterfly and meet lots of new girlfriends. His hound dog traits do come out from time to time. He is a hunter and sniffer and he could care less about chasing frivolous tennis balls or frisbees. He is not a chewer and he is not a begger of food. He would love a work from home mom or dad.

      "Lincoln is a 5 year old Rhodesian Ridgdback, Boxer, German shepherd mix. He has spent his whole life around his brother and two female dogs that are 4 and 5 years his senior. He loves to be outdoors. He is leash trained and if in a familiar place is great off leash as well. He is not fond around felines but is nice with other dogs if introduced carefully for he can tend to be shy. He acts well enough around young kids of 4 years or older. He does fancy himself a lapdog so be forewarned. When he gets excited he tends to be a little jumpy but calms down relatively quickly. He does prefer sleeping in a bed next to his humans but is fine with floor space or a dog bed. Lincoln weights about 100 pounds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Luca is a little shy at first, he has had his heart broken by unworthy people in the past, so patience with him at first is the best way to win his heart. But once he warms up, you get the full Luca experience. He will adore you just as much as you adore him, 70 pounds of total adoration, devotion and kisses. Had a bad day? Luca can help. He can lounge around and watch a movie with you or lift your spirits with a little rousing game of fetch and tag in the backyard with his Kong. He will plop his big fat head in your lap, look up at you with those gorgeous green eyes and you can see how much he loves you and wants to make life better for you. This guy will touch your soul and you will know love.\n",

      "Luca is a Mastiff/Bully mix about 3 or 4 years old (as of 2018). He weighs in around 70 pounds, which is all solid muscle. He is neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, good with properly introduced dogs, but especially good with the ladies. His has beautiful green eyes and a shiny. gorgeous fawn colored coat with white markings. He hasn't had any prior experience with cats so we suggest a home without any feline companions, or maybe a very dog savvy cat. He is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic obedience (but can have a bout of 'bully hearing' when sniffing something especially interesting in the yard lol), loves car rides and is an all around good dog. Because of his size, we recommend a home without small children. He can get very exuberant in his play and may accidentally knock small children down. We want both Luca and his new family to be happy so a home experienced with bully breeds is a must.\n",

      "Nico is now 3 1/2 years old (as of March 2019). He came into the shelter as an owner surrender in April 2017 due to the family leaving town for an emergency. They decided to reclaim him, only to surrender him again because they were moving. Obviously, this makes us very sad for Nico, and want nothing more than for him to find his forever home. Nico was purchased as a puppy from a breeder, so he has only known one home. His owners told us that he is house trained, crate trained and knows the commands sit, down, stay and come. During the day, Nico was kept in the yard, and at night he was brought inside. His volunteers buddies love him and truly enjoy their time taking him out for walks and play time. Nico just made it into our doggy play groups here at the shelter, and did really well! We just can not wait to see Nico in his forever home!

      "Hi, my name is Duke. I am young and love to run and play, and there is so much to learn for me, because I have not been taught how to behave real nice. I think if you have a little bit of patience to teach me how to behave properly you would really like me a lot. I love people and I also like kids a lot, but since I am so big and goofy I am not such a great fit for little children, I run around a lot and might accidentally run them over. Bigger kids would be great. Also I really like to hug people, so even though i love doing it I think I have to learn to control it, just because I tend to forgot how big I am. I so much hope there is someone out there for me, so I can have a real family!\n",

Ham Ham loves the classics, hamburgers, Hamilton soundtrack, black forest Ham sandwiches, a drive in the Hamptons, all while taking selfies, because he's a huge ham. This pup will be a big boy with so much love to give. He is a regular couch potato, but loves a good game of chase in the yard (until he finds a shady spot to chill). He loves meal time whether it's his or yours. He is starting to enjoy walks on a leash in the yard. He is progressing with his house training and crate training. Going to bed at night is easy for him, but during the day he gets mad about it. He loves to cuddle and watch TV. He also loves to pounce at bigger dogs and pretend he's bigger than they are as he is practicing for the day he will be larger than them. He will make an amazing companion dog for any family. He plays with kids well, but watch those sharp puppy teeth!\n",

      "Brave Bella found herself homeless on unfamiliar streets with unfamiliar people trying to fend for her life.  Luckily for Bella, there was a compassionate person that noticed her, and concerned for BellaÃ¢ÂÂs safety, began to watch over her and provide her with food and water.  It quickly became apparent that Bella may have been owned by someone at one time, but despite their search for BellaÃ¢ÂÂs owner, no one came forward for her. Brave Bella is very ready and open to move forward into a kind, loving, home with humans fawning all over her. Based on BellaÃ¢ÂÂs looks, we guess that she could be a Schipperke Ã¢ÂÂ Shiba Inu mix.  Regardless of her breed, she is beautiful!!!  Bella is very loving and welcomes any attention you are willing to give her.  She has gotten along with the dogs she has met so far, and she is always happy to greet new people with kisses.  We are uncertain how she is with cats.  Bella would do great in a home with Adults and older kids over 16 and do well with another sweet dog. She weighs 36 lbs, is about 2 years old, she is spayed, microchipped and up to date with her vaccinations and heartworm negative.

      "\n",
      "Storm is another one of Mystic's puppies, her siblings being Rogan, Victor, and Wolverine. Storm is a little bit more nervous and can take some time to get used to everything. Storm is sensitive to sudden noises, so she would be best in a quiet environment. When Storm sleeps, she enjoys sleeping on right next human and she uses the pee pad well. Storm is active, enjoying her walks and play times. She may seem shy the first few weeks at her new home, but will open up once trust is built. \n",

      "Storm will prefer to be with ONLY fur family but if another dog is present, she would be best with another senior dog or calmer dog. She is a wonderful, sweet, and adorable puppy that would love a forever home! \n",

      "Prior to rescue, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization and it takes time for them to learn about life as a family pet. Common skills such as house training and leash walking may often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.\n",

      "He was then adopted in January 2017 to a family with younger kids. We thought it was a good match but we discovered that Zeke needs a stronger owner to keep him in line. He needs to be in a home with a schedule, that includes his walking and exercise time. Zeke loves to walk and needs to be walked to burn off a lot of his puppy energy. You have to watch him otherwise he will become the alpha of the house, and you. He is fine in his foster home because he knows Mom is the alpha and she won't let the little stinker dominate the house. Besides loving walks, he loves to sit on the couch with you, riding in the car, going and meeting new people. He is about 20lbs and 3 yrs old. He is very affectionate.\n",

      "Cassie is a sweet and loving girl who needs a special home. She has hip issues that will need to be addressed in the future, but she doesn't seem to currently be in pain. She's been in foster since June, so she could lose some weight and we could see if that would help her hips. She's lived with both cats and dog in foster, she's house-trained, and loves to spend time in the yard. She's still a big gal, so the shelter isn't the most comfortable place for her to be. Because of that, we're hoping to get her adopted straight from her foster home. If you're interested in meeting Cassie, please come in and fill out an adoption application. We will work on a modified first-come, first-served method. We will review all applications for suitability, and if we feel your home would be a good fit, we will pass your information on to the foster. The foster will then arrange a meeting with you and Cassie. Once the right adopter is found, the adopter will come in here and do the paperwork, then take Cassie home!\n",

She doesn't seem to \\\"take\\\" to other dogs very well. We think she would be best as a single dog. She is exceptionally beautiful, however, and has VERY SOFT fur. \n",

      "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.To speed up the adoption process, please complete our Pre-Adoption Application.Bandit is a very sweet lady! She loves cuddling/getting love and attention. Belly rubs are a MUST for this girl. She loves to throw herself on the ground for them. Knows sit and is showing lots of improvements with the leash. Pulls when she gets excited(she did very well with a gentle leader and a more calm dog as an example). Has had no trouble with strangers, or new human friends, young or old. (adores every single person she meets) She is very curious! Loves to check out what's going on around her. She loves short walks around a block or two, a couple times a day, and running around a backyard. Bandit is being fostered with kids, cats, and dogs. While she has not shown much interest in the cats at her foster home she was very interested in the cats at the adoption center. So for the safety of our feline friends we think it is best she go to a home with no kitties. She loves kids (and all people). Has been doing great in her crate and loves to hang out in the yard. She is being fostered with other dogs. She loves when older puppies come into her foster home. She will play with them for hours. She can be rude to other dogs so we have been working on that (and the reason that our trainig is required). She is the perfect mix of play and chill. *** Becuase Bandit has been working on sharing things with other dogs (and doing great) she is required to enroll in training with the rescue & YDBF. We would like to set her up for success and work closely with her forever home! ***\n",

      "Happy Tails Adoption Center is open on Sundays from 12-5. We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me?

      "Handsome Jake is a wonderful family companion. During the day he likes to roam around the yard and chase squirrels and chipmunks; he likes to go on walks or tag along on car rides. At night, Jake loves nothing more than laying on his back and having his belly rubbed. If you could pet him 24/7, Jake would sit there and soak it up the entire time. He loves attention!!\n",

      "Athena is a very sweet girl who would love to have a new home. Although she can be shy upon first meeting new people it is well worth the wait to gain her trust.

      "Klaus was found by a young couple in rural Luzerne county on a back road, alone and wandering. Concerned for him, they took him to their home and began the search for his family. After a few days of knocking on doors, posting his photo on social media and reaching out to local vets and shelters, they came to the sad conclusion that he didn't have a family looking for him and may have been dumped. Though the couple felt he would be a great addition to their home, they knew couldn't keep him with their busy work and school schedules, so they reached out to ARC. But from his brief time in their home, we learned this big boy is friendly to all humans, walks well on a leash and seemed more afraid of cats than threatening!While we're not sure what mix of breeds Klaus is, he is a big boy at almost 90LBS! While of an impressive size, Klaus isn't intimidating in his personality or behavior. He is friendly with all people, seems uninterested in other dogs and from what his finders told us, afraid of cats. He does have an old injury to his right eye that causes minor vision impairments but we've scheduled an appointment with our vets to determine the extent of the injury and his range of vision but we feel that Klaus has adapted to his limited vision and it won't affect him when placed in a home.

      "Magnus is a big sweet lazy lug. If you have the pleasure of meeting this handsome fella, he will no doubt put a smile on your face. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a lover & a leaner. HeÃ¢ÂÂs 5-6 yrs old by our vetÃ¢ÂÂs estimate. We believe heÃ¢ÂÂs a Saint Bernard/ Great Pyrenees mix. HeÃ¢ÂÂs good with dogs & cats. He loves kids. HeÃ¢ÂÂs currently being fostered by a family with a toddler & heÃ¢ÂÂs doing great. He does like to give lots of kisses to little ones. Unfortunately he came to us with heartworms but has received the injections so now we wait for enough time to pass for us to test him. HeÃ¢ÂÂs neutered & UTD on vaccinations & preventatives since with the rescue. Sadly we have no history on this sweet guy as he came to us from a shelter. HeÃ¢ÂÂs looking for a family to foster him while we wait for him to be free of the parasites. Then once hrs cleared, he can officially be adopted. Other dogs in the home arenÃ¢ÂÂt susceptible as long as theyÃ¢ÂÂre on preventatives which all dogs should be. There is a $300 adoption fee to help us recoup some of the cost of his vet care. HeÃ¢ÂÂs currently being fostered in the Nashville TN area. We do adopt out of state but require adopters to travel to foster home to pick up their dog. If youÃ¢ÂÂre interested in giving this amazing boy the home he deserves, you can find our adoption application at this link https://www.luckyfarmsrescue.org/adoption\n",

He is an easy going good boy who is house trained and just wants to spend his days chilling or hanging at the dog park with his friends.  He can be trusted to roam and guard your home while you are out and while you're home. He is perfect on a leash and pretty much everything.\n",

      "All known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.\n",

      "Ferdinand is a very sweet 88 lb Newfie mix boy who is getting used to being in a house. He is about 7 years old, but still young at heart. Despite living outside all his life, he has only had one accident since he came to us the end of July. He does great with his two, much smaller, foster doggy brothers as well as feline brother and sister. He must be on a slip lead or harness as if sees another dog, possible new friend, or furry animal to chase he does pull a bit and collar could come off; otherwise he walks very well on a leash. He can jump a 4 ft gate if you are on the other side and he decides he wants to be with you, so would recommend 6 ft fence or not being out unsupervised. He isn't a fan of kennels but has been fine wandering the house while his foster mom is gone at work. He did suffer a spinal stroke recently but is recovering faster than the vet thought he would, and the vet doesn't anticipate future issues from it. Ferdinand's adoption fee is $200.

      "\n",
      "Found living under a house at just six weeks old, Crickett was kindly upgraded to living *within* a house, along with another dog and 3 cats. But as time went on, the family realized that their small, yardless home (which included another dog and three cats) was not a good fit for a growing adolescent with working dog genes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Crickett arrived at our shelter at 1 1/2 years old, with matted fur, filthy ears, overgrown toenails and extra poundage. We've cleaned her up (just like Cinderella!) and put her on a diet-and-exercise program--including regular trips to doggy daycare, thanks to our good friends at The Pet Spot and Red Dog! At this point, she's a bit more reserved that you might expect from her breed mix--preferring to calmly mix and mingle with the other dogs ... or find a comfy spot to settle in and watch the action. \n",
      "\n",
      "We get the feeling Crickett has led a bit of a sheltered life up to this point, but that's starting to change as our volunteers get her out and about. Here's one volunteer's account of a recent outing: \\\"Crickett is still settling in, but is so sweet and gentle. She gives the softest kisses and enjoys attention. She was a bit nervous on our walk, but every time she paused and I encouraged her, she soldiered on, sometimes doing a little hop of excitement when I told her she was a good girl. By the middle of our trip she had absolutely mastered leash walking, only stopping twice when the leash went under her front leg. (Crickett stopped walking and held up her leg so I could adjust the leash. So ladylike!) She loved walking at the park but was mellow with a bit of hopping around with excitement. I think a little happiness and confidence are already bubbling to the surface.\\\n",

      "Meet the incredible Zorro! This hunka hunka burning love is the perfect age Ã¢ÂÂ somewhere between 5-6 years old and has the best paws in the entire world! We swear! We expect nothing less from a newfy mix Ã¢ÂÂ their lovely paws just make us swoon and his are no exception Ã¢ÂÂ patty-cake paw-paws!!! \n",

We just donÃ¢ÂÂt know Ã¢ÂÂ whatever it is Ã¢ÂÂ he got some brains as well. He is completely capable of giving some major slurps with his black spotted tongue* but he is not a drooler (thank heavens)! He does have some great energy and needs a big yard with at least 5 foot fences. If he can - he will go walk-about if he gets bored in the back yard and will go over his current fence but only goes to the front of the house or does it to entice his foster mom to play catch me if you can! So a minimum 5Ã¢ÂÂ foot is a necessity with nothing he can use to help him over the fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth be told Ã¢ÂÂ he is a 65ish pound lap dog (or mini-newfy) who loves his walkies, his car rides and his fellow foster dogs and even gets along with the cats (after he learned how to keep his play gentle). He is most certainly the social butterfly at his foster house and greets everyone with a smile and wag. But make sure you do the math and calculate the size of dog bed required so Zorro has a comfy place to lay his head Ã¢ÂÂ or you will find yourself smashed on the sofa with Zorro snoring softly on top of you. While we readily admit most of his bulk is hair (lots and lots of hair) Ã¢ÂÂ he is still a big boy Ã¢ÂÂ good news is he is a grown-up now (kind of). He is not a toy boy and you can throw balls for him all day long and he will chase them all day long butÃ¢ÂÂ¦ he did not get the right retriever genes that would make him bring balls backÃ¢ÂÂ¦ so as an exercise prompter for YOU Ã¢ÂÂ he gets an A+.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zorro isnÃ¢ÂÂt afraid of much (and certainly not scared when foster mom plays boy band music loudly while vacuuming) but he is afraid of loud noises Ã¢ÂÂ especially gun shots. He is getting better but he prefers not to join in any holiday celebrations that include fireworks. We do know in a previous life he was shot at and we promised him no more. So while his newfy ancestry calls for the ability to haul heavy loads everywhere and anywhere Ã¢ÂÂ he wonÃ¢ÂÂt be hauling any backpacks for your hunting getaway. He absolutely loves car rides and is the best passenger and is always ready for an adventure!\n",

This sweet girl has had a rough start in life - in her first home, with a chicken farmer, she lived in a kennel because she chased chickens (remember, she was a puppy...). Her next home only lasted a month, because the woman who took her home had an invalid mother and this girl jumped up on her (remember, she was just a year old... with no previous training...). And oh yes- she wasn't housetrained, she peed in the house. As it turned out, she actually had a nasty urinary infection, and once treated has not had a problem with peeing in the house... \n",
      "\n",
      "Poor little dog! Her foster mom, who got Yana to be a companion to her other dog, says \\\"She will need training but has been learning fast how to live in a home instead of a kennel.  She is now housetrained and healthy, has been spayed, is up to date on her shots.  She is shy with strangers and a bit fearful of men but loves my husband now that she has gotten to know him.  She hasnÃ¢ÂÂt had a chance to socialize with other dogs and needs a quiet home with no other pets or young children.  She is exuberant and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt know how to interact.  She has a tendency to herd me to get my attention now that she is learning not to jump on me.\\\n",

      "Meet Beatrice. She was surrendered to us by a family who found her stray but couldn't keep her. This little girl is very special. At 16 weeks old, she is so happy-go lucky and exudes pure joy. We're unsure of her breed but she seems to have some bearded collie and / or skye terrier traits. She's approximately 16 lbs now and will likely be 40-50 lbs full grown. She loves everyone, especially humans! Very smart, eager to please and such a good girl!! Would be happy to have a job or do agility. She also seems to have hair not fur so we suspect she won't be a shedder. Sleeps through the night and is quickly learning her housebreaking skills in just a few short days.\n",

He loves to give slobbery kisses and to climb in people's laps, even though he really doesn't fit.Tarlton was born in 2006 and is on a special diet for allergies. He knows tricks like \\\"roll over,? \\\"twirl? and \\\"crawl.? He's a world-class cuddler and bed-hog, though he also enjoys long walks. Tarlton will make an amazing friend for a dog-savvy person who can give him a little guidance. He's a sensitive guy who craves love, and he can't wait to give his heart to someone special.Tarlton is part of our Single Pets* program!

      "This is Lola. She was at a high kill shelter in Alabama. Our foster family went to the shelter to pick up two puppies for our organization. But the 11 year old son of the foster family felt so moved while at the shelter when he walked by LolaÃ¢ÂÂs kennel...he cried and cried with feelings of empathy and sadness. Lola sitting in the back of her kennel with her head hung low. Hope was no longer something she had. She had given up on everything. She was afraid and very depressed...loneliness was the new norm for her. She came to realize that no one was ever coming for her and that she knew she was going to die in that shelter any day now. The 11 yo foster boy could feel all of LolaÃ¢ÂÂs emotions in the few minutes of seeing her. He noticed the dogs in the nearby kennels were all jumping at the gate and barking loudly. But not Lola...she didnÃ¢ÂÂt make a sound, didnÃ¢ÂÂt move a muscle. He told his mom Ã¢ÂÂMom, we canÃ¢ÂÂt leave this dog here. She will die in here. No one else is going to save her. SheÃ¢ÂÂs crying mom.Ã¢ÂÂ His mom said yes to fostering her too! We agreed to take her into our adoption program and find her a forever home. \n",

      "We met Lola that afternoon. What a gem she is!! She is most kind hearted soul. She oozes gratefulness with every look and movement. She is calm, and she is soothing to your own soul. Something about her draws you to her. She loves children and is like a grandma to them...she lays next to them and just Ã¢ÂÂchecking on them.Ã¢ÂÂ She has also taken on to mother the two puppies we rescued. She acts like they are her puppies. She licks them and loves them. \n",

      "Meet our sweet senior Marge!  This adorable girl was originally dumped in the desert along with her life-mate.  They were taken to a shelter where they sat for a full year with no hopes of adoption.  SHR heard about them and absolutely had to take them in.  Shortly afterÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Walter past away due to age.  Marge was of course initially brokenhearted.  Now, Marge is learning to live life to the fullest!  We found a wonderful foster home for her and weÃ¢ÂÂre learning so much about her.  Marge is housebroken, great in the house and loves to lounge on the patio in the sun.  She is cuddly and insists on attention, if you stop petting her she pokes her nose at you to continue.  Marge is happy and loves being part of a family, something she probably never had before.  While she loved Walter, she is not fond of other dogs, she wants to be the queen of her own castle.  Marge has a sparkle in her cloudy eyes and a bounce in her step, she loves life and all the new adventures sheÃ¢ÂÂs exploring.  DonÃ¢ÂÂt let her gray muzzle fool you, this girl is full of life and ready for the next chapter Ã¢ÂÂ could that chapter have your name on it??  For more information on our wonderful senior, please call Toni at 602-686-4158 or email azbullygirl@hotmail.com\n",

This pup also gets along stupendously well with other dogs, so he would appreciate having a doggy sibling or friend to play with! He spends a lot of his time wrestling with his foster sibling. A fenced-in yard would be perfect for him to run around in! Additionally, Brady can use a doggy door and likes sunbathing on the porch. Squirrels and rabbits greatly excite him, but he is untested with cats. When given a treat or at meal time, Brady is extremely gentle and well-behaved. He also has an enormous heart, so he will develop a connection with your family in an instant! His favorite activities are snuggling, resting his head on members of his family, and belly rubs. Do not be surprised if he wants to cuddle up with you in bed! Due to this bond, he will need owners that will dedicate the time to properly introduce him to strangers who come into his house, as he is protective and shows guarding behavior towards unannounced visitors. Brady does not show this behavior towards anything else, and once comfortable with strangers, he is extremely pleasant. With the proper care, training, and love, Brady can be an amazing dog that is sure to bring happiness to your family!\n",

      "My name is DINO aka BUDDY and I'm a handsome 1.5 yr M Tan Hound/Mastiff X. I'm 70 lbs of PURE DREAMBOAT!! I was rescued from a kill shelter and what a save I was! I'm a gorgeous boy with dreamy bedroom eyes. SOOO SWEET but   very very hand shy. My previous owner was not very nice to me because I don't trust hands and I will duck away from them when you try to pet me. You have to give me time to warm up to you and then I'll let you pet me. I'm still young and am still very puppylike.. I'm curious about everything and very silly, clumsy and goofy. As most puppies do, I like to chew on shoes and other hard plastic items and get into the trash if it's out. I'm very playful and love to play \\\"catch me if you can\\\" I LOVE LOVE LOVE other dogs and will pull you across the street to greet them. I definitely need more leash training because I pull like a horse. Since I\\\"m so shy and skittish, young kids make me nervous and jumpy so older kids ages 11 yrs + would be best. I'm fine with cats but I really MUST BE with another dog to feel more secure and to pal around with. I love to run in the grass so a fenced in yard would be wonderful!! I'm a SILLY GOOSE who has ALOT of potential to become a REGAL PRINCE of a dog with someone who has the patience, compassion and easy going fun loving attitude to forgive me for my ackwardness and give me the support I need to be a more confident dog.  I will be your loyal \\\"Buddy\\\"  for life!!  \n",

      "The nameÃ¢ÂÂs Lenny! Gasp, sigh, aww, screeching brakes Ã¢ÂÂ¦ I see youÃ¢ÂÂve noticed my stunning good looks, lovely brindle coat, known to stop traffic!  I enjoy walks with my peeps; walk well on the harness/leash; gently taking treats; have nailed sit like a rock star and am working on refining other commands, as well as not being too forward in meeting pups.  Peeps, IÃ¢ÂÂm the total package: a gentleman, looks, soul, smarts, fun and I love to snuggle. Though just a pup, I haven't had the best of luck in relationships - go figure- relationships need patience, time, communication. If you agree, think I can't possibly be for real, you'll just have to meet me to find out for yourself. \n",

      "Hey there, I'm Chunk! I'm a fun-loving little pup looking for my new best friend! I've got a Purple dot, which means that I want to go home with an experienced pet owner because I can be a bit possessive over my tasty treats. My friends here at the shelter can tell you more about my specific behavioral needs, and that will help you figure out if I might do well in your home! Speaking of home, if your household has children under the age of 14, I'm probably not the right choice. Since I'll be a very large doggie I will require plenty of training. I like to play all the time and tug of war is my favorite game! I love getting attention from people and with love and training I'm sure I'll be an all-star pet!

The card board box! You can sit in it, you can chew on it, and you can rip it to shreds! Big stuffed animals on the other hand are great to carry around, lay down with, and of course, chew! My spotlight moment takes place center stage when I bust through a wall! Ka-pow! Makes my name super fitting right? Im a huge goofball and dont always realize my own strength so someone who has experience with big dogs and basic obedience would be best suited to take care of me. Small children arenÃ¢ÂÂt recommended just because I am so big and strong. I get along best with female dogs so I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt mind a playmate and a home with a yard would be much preferred so I can run around and get all my energy out!

      "Those eyes will stare deep into your soul. This is one human friendly dog. He thrives on the attention of human friends. He was picked up as a stray with Abbott, so we assume he is dog friendly, but Costello really shines when getting attention from people. Since he was picked up as a stray, we don't know anything about his household behaviors, as in if he's potty trained, but he'd probably be a quick learner. Costello weighs in at a mere 88 pounds so is small compared to Abbott. Costello needs a strong handler, even if you have a fenced in yard, you'll need to be strong enough to handle him at vet appointments, etc.\n",

      "Ramona is a large lady on the search for her forever home! With Ramona, you won't be dealing with any puppy-nonsense like tearing up furniture or using your house as a bathroom, cuz as a 5y/o adult, she understands how to conduct herself in a home. She is a very laid-back gal who appreciates things like dog beds, blankets to lay on and bones to chew. She enjoys her morning walk (walks great on leash, but do note she is very strong and can pull you over to something if she wants to), and then happily naps the rest of the day. Ramona has never met a stranger; she loves everyone she meets! She would be an excellent candidate for a take-to-work companion (rides well in the car), or even doing therapy work! Additionally, since Ramona loves people so much, she would love a home with some kids (cuz it's that many more hands to pet her)! Though with her clumsy ness and her totally-unaware-of-her-size-ness, she may accidentally knock over littles; so kids aged 5 and up would probably be best. Ramona would be excellent as an only dog, so she can get all of the attention! She could also go to a home with other pets, as long as they respect her space. She only wishes to coexist and not be a play-partner. Do consider the slobber factor with the mastiff-side of her makeup! She is a messy drinker and will need her mouth wiped after she drinks, along with your floor by the water dish. Ramona also takes a daily medication (Proin) for bladder control, but she does still have occasional accidents while sleeping. She was found as a stray, and was quite skinny at intake; she is working on gaining weight as well as growing back fur in patches she lost due to flea allergies. Ramona is spayed and microchipped, and will be a wonderful addition to any family that loves XL breeds! Her adoption fee is $250. To adopt Ramona apply at www.rescueofhope.com/adopt\n",

      "Apollo was surrendered by his owners when they fell on hard times and weren't able to provide Apollo with proper food or any veterinary care. He came in as an urgent rescue and went to stay at our vet's office while we assessed his medical situation. Apollo came in very weak in his hind end. At 127 pounds, he was emaciated. He was infested with fleas and had horrible ear infections. He also had intestinal parasites but thankfully tested negative for heartworms. Apollo did test positive for a tick disease called Ehrlichia. His bloodwork was consistent with a dog who is starving but does not show permament organ damage which is good.Apollo had xrays taken and the vets didn't see anything that would explain his hind end weakness, except for some arthritis in his spine, but his hips and knees look good. They think it just may be a combination of his startvation, arthritis and his tick virus causing the issues. After a few days of regular meals and medications, seemed to be walking a little better. Over time he's definitely gained strength in his back end, he does still have some weakness but so much better than when he came in.Like many dogs who have been starved, Apollo will growl at other dogs who approch his food and so he needs to be fed separately. He's been through a horrible experience and so needs a patient family to slowly integrate him in with other dogs. He seems to do better with female dogs and he lived with a small dog in his previous home. He's fantastic with people but since we don't have a history of him with children, a home with older kids (12+) would be best. He also has met some cats and done well with them.Apollo's adoption fee is waived so he is a free adoption!Apollo is being fostered near Porter, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!\n",

      "Hello everyone, I'm Otis! Much like my other namesakes I'm not a singer, publisher, or an athlete. I'm just a large guy looking for a human to take a chance on me. You see, I was originially found as a stray in rough condition. My skin was red and bleeding, very itchy, and missing most of the fur on my back and hind end. and the worst part? I didn't know human kindness. I most likely have been on my own for quite sometime and takes its toll on a fella. Now that I'm here though, the staff has shown me that I shouldn't be fearful and can start to trust again. They've been giving me medicated baths, lots and lots of treats, and a back scratch here and there. My ideal home would be with adults only that can help me acclimate to indoor living. I've even met a few dogs here, and don't mind them as long as they're respectful. I'm just a lonely heart that would love someone to build a forever bond with. Could you be that person for me?\n",

      "Kingsley is a cute little Schnauzer/JRT mix under a year old.  He weighs about 10 lbs. He is a shadow at your feet as long as you let him and he can keep up. He loves toys and treats and is gentle with taking them. He will slyly creep up in your lap to get random pats on his little head. He loves to run with children, He will be quick to steal a kids toy for a game of chase and he likes to play in a water hose. He is quick to warn of Ã¢ÂÂbad guysÃ¢ÂÂ and heÃ¢ÂÂs a mighty protector. He will be the first to alert you of anything out of the ordinary. HeÃ¢ÂÂs working on Ã¢ÂÂplaying deadÃ¢ÂÂ when you say bang bang (His foster mom's kids are great teachers). Overall very very sweet - still a little shy sometimes but no strange dogs (he'd be best as an only dog).  He adjusts to strangers in time, and will be friendly, but lots of patience.  We're not sure about cats - they stay away from the dogs. HeÃ¢ÂÂs doing well with potty training.  His foster mom says  he can be an ankle biter with strangers that visit the home (he had to be kenneled) and is working with him positive reinforcements with treats to curb it. Seems he was shy shy shy at first but once he warmed up he thinks heÃ¢ÂÂs a mighty guard dog    He does get along with the other resident dogs.  No children under the age of 12.  Fenced yard is a must.  Adoption fee $275.\n",

      "Hi there!  IÃ¢ÂÂm Nyla and I am looking for a Ã¢ÂÂfureverÃ¢ÂÂ home.  Everyone says that IÃ¢ÂÂm quite the catch being just 8 years, around 8 lbs. and with my expressive eyes!  Who am I to argue?  You see, I recently found myself in a pretty rough spot and needed a second chance.  The awesome folks at TRI said that they would help me find a family of my own.  Maybe you can be that family?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you make that decision, I have to tell you a little secret.  I have never lived inside a house Ã¢ÂÂ I lived my life in a puppy mill!  Can you imagine?  Little old me living outside all of my life with almost no human contact!  So, I was told that I have to learn Ã¢ÂÂhow to be a real dog.Ã¢ÂÂ  IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure what that means yet, but I am willing to do anything if it means finding a home. It will just take some time and patience while I learn the ropes.  My foster family has introduced me to all kinds of new things - dog beds, toys, walks, play time, and cuddling.  I had no idea such great things existed!  And I just love hanging out with other dogs, so it would be great to have a canine brother or sister to play with in my new home!\n",
      "\n",
      "My past experiences have also left me a bit shy and weary when meeting new people.  My new family will need to be patient with me and help me to learn that people are ok.  I would also do best in a quiet home without small children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, now you know my secrets.  Are you still willing to give me a furever home?  If so, please contact my adoption consultant, Pam, at 330-347-1010 or therescueinn@gmail.com.  She can fill you in on the details.  I canÃ¢ÂÂt wait to meet my family!\n",

      "Meet Avalon, or as we call her in her foster home, Ava.  Ava is a very sweet 4 year old chihuahua possibly Doxie mix.  SheÃ¢ÂÂs shy at first, but once she feels safe, sheÃ¢ÂÂs happy and outgoing.  Ava is great with other dogs and does well on a leash.  She uses a dog door, or stands by the door to be let out, and has never once had an accident in her foster home.  Ava does best with calm, older children, as little ones scare her.  She enjoys playing with her ball, and she loves being outside when itÃ¢ÂÂs not too hot.  She will bark to defend her yard.  Ava is about 17 pounds.  She rides very nicely in the car and enjoys looking out the window.  She sleeps on her dog bed through the night. Ava loves to be with her people, you can tell because she has a huge smile when you come home!  To meet Ava, please text her foster mom at (702) 366-6391.

      "After being hit by a car, little Sabrina spent 8 weeks in a cast while her bones healed.  She's 10 years old, but loves to adventure by car, trail or river.  Snuggles are her favorite, but she's no couch potato.  Sabrina lives with several big dogs and enjoys their company.  Never once have we heard her bark.  SabrinaÃ¢ÂÂs bones are now healed but weÃ¢ÂÂve learned that she has an enlarged heart and a leaky bladder.  Sabrina does require daily medication for her heart but nothing stops this little dog from living life to it's fullest. And Sabrina doesnÃ¢ÂÂt urinate on the carpet but will on tile and she also sleeps through the night without urinating. \n",

      "Lacy is white with spiky thin hair and weighs about 4-5 lbs.  She appears to be about 10 months old. She is spayed. microchipped and has had her vacinations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Lacy will need an adopter who has no other pets, or a pet who is quiet and not interested in playing with her. She is afraid of everything. Pets, noise, people, other dogs. She came from a central valley shelter injured. They 'think' she was hit by a car, but I'm wondering if it is really a case of abuse.  She had a broken tail which has now been amputated half way down. When the hair grows back you probably won't notice the half gone tail. She also had a pelvic injury and a wound on her hip which has healed nicely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Even though her physical wounds have healed for the most part, her mental wounds still exist.  She will need a patient, gentle and loving owner who will handle her with great thoughtfulness.  It appears that Lacy was held a lot or carried by a human and she feels comfortable being held.  But she needs socialization with people and pets so she can regain her self esteme and confidence. It will take time and patience.\n",

      "I had just left the theater and was driving home when I spotted two little ears sticking out of a clump of grass in a nearby field. I stopped the car. Beneath the ears were two wide frightened little eyes. When I got out of the car, 4 little feet went into action and the eyes and ears disappeared into a woodsy area. I came back and set a humane trap. The next morning a frightened little puppy looked up at me with those two little eyes, wider than ever, within the confines of the trap, shivering like a leaf. Â Men living in a nearby house informed me that this poor little pup had been living in the field off the scraps they'd fed her for a month. As young and tiny as she was back then, I considered it a miracle that she survived that long in the cold late winter weather. \n",
      "Once she was with me, her rehab into the world of humans had begun. For days she'd shakeÂ in fear anytime anyoneÂ came near, so I took things slowly. Within a couple of week the little orphan's fear was beginning to melt away as she slowly began to trust a human, perhaps for the first time ever. \n",

I didn't have a lot of companionship from my human. I am making so much improvement with my foster humans who shower me with love and attention. I will need a home where my people are willing to give me as much time as I need to flourish into the great little dog that I am working on becoming.

These dogs have lived their lives outside in large pens so are NOT housetrained, not crate-trained, not leash trained.

If you have other dogs and they are not on prevention you will first need to get with your Veterinarian to have your dog(s) tested and purchase prevention for it/them. Heartworm prevention is a BIG DEAL to us and while we are happy to educate, please also talk to your Veterinarian about its importance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Goldie is an adorable, 7 yr old, chihuahua/pug mix. She weighs 14lbs. This girl actually came to us in rescue in 2010 at 6 weeks old. Sadly, after living with her adopted family all these years, she was returned back to us at no fault of her own. We always take our dogs back so we welcomed this girl with open arms. She has been a joy since being back with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Goldie has always lived with other dogs and has done fine, but did become overwhelmed in her previous home because she did not get the attention she deserved and was among way too many dogs. Now that she is in a foster home with 2 other dogs, she is doing great. She also loves kids and shares her foster home with a few. She can be a a little territorial in her crate when she is eating but we have seen no other issues at all. She enjoys her laid back dog friends and loves her people....and belly rubs!! \n",
      "\n",
      "She is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and on monthly heartworm/flea/tick prevention. Goldie prefers to not have to stay in the crate, especially at night by herself so she does well being out at night or even baby gated in a kitchen during the day. She walks very well on a leash and does great with her Freedom No Pull Harness for walks. She is house trained although it does take her about 24-48 hrs to transition into a new, but is smooth sailing after that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Goldie has seen a canine chiropractor for her right front leg/elbow just to make sure everything is okay, she sort of has a limp when she trots. Doc said that it is most likely a genetic deformity and there is not much that can be done. She is on joint supplements and doing very well. We also checked her hips and spine and that all checked out great. She is not special needs at all, we just like to disclose all we know about our girl. :) \n",

      "This girl deserves a great home that will love her unconditionally! \n",

      "Dasher is a young Chi mix. We think he's mixed with Jack Russell Terrier. He's a bit shy but he warms up quickly. He's about ten pounds, and around 2 years old. He gets along well with other small dogs but he is afraid of large dogs. Because of the situation he came from, we think it'd be best that he be adopted to a home without small children. He was abandoned in a back yard when the owner moved, along with several other dogs. Dasher can run like the wind so he'll require a secure fence. He loves to go outside but he's happy being a couch potato too. He's not aggressive and he is gentle around smaller dogs. He's not destructive. He's crate trained and potty trained and does fairly well on a leash but could use more practice. He enjoys toys and treats and being petted. Requires a fence in yard.  Dasher is heartworm negative, neuter and Rabies shot.  If interested in Dasher please go to www.arkansaschihuahuarescue.org and fill out an adoption application for Dasher. HIs adoption fee is $150.00\n",

Macaw came to us from the County shelter where he was originally taken in as a stray. He has done great with men and women, but has never been around children that we know of. Macaw has also done well around dogs his size but we do not know if he has ever lived with another dog. He would prefer to meet any potential canine companions prior to adoption. acaw will need a patient home that understands he may require training as he adjusts in his forever home.

      "Toots is a spunky 2 year old Chihuahua/ Pomeranian mix looking for her forever home. She weighs 9.5 pounds and is full grown. Toots is a shy girl that likes to take it slow when meeting new people. She is good with men and women, but has never been around any children that we know of. Toots is good with cats but would do best as the only dog in the home. She is house broken, kennel trained, walks good on a leash and rides well in the car. Toots is an active girl and loves playing with toys and getting out to play in the fresh air! She does occasionally gossip and would not do well in an apartment environment. Toots currently has asymptomatic canine oral papillomas (oral warts) that is contagious to other dogs but not humans. Our veterinarian said the warts should resolve on their own in 4-8 weeks. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, vet checked. Her adoption fee is $240 and includes a free vet visit and 30 days of free pet insurance. To meet her, come to our location at 1102 W. Hatcher Road in Phoenix 85021, open Tues-Sunday 11am to 6pm. On weekends, call for location as some of our dogs attend off site adoption events, 602-944-2440\n",

Bella is a strong girl that knows exactly what she wants and when she wants it! She will be the one to pick her person. Bella is selective about who she likes and who she will allow to give her attention and when. She is good with men and women. Bella would do best in a home with no children. She has done great with other dogs of all sizes. She is unique and is missing her right rear foot, it does not bother her, we assume it has been like that since she was born. Bella is house broken, kennel trained, walks good on a leash and rides well in the car. Bella would do best in a home that is patient and will let Bella come to them. If Bella's new home has a pool it must be fenced for her safety! She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and vet checked.

      "Well, I am a very interesting dog... I love to be able and jump in your lap, give you a quick kiss then quickly jump off and maybe talk to you a bit. I can be a bit vocal when I am unsure of my environment or new people but you just have to let me have my say and then I get over it. I will be best in a home with only adults and maybe one other small dog. I will need to have patient dog owners that understand I have an aversion to leashes. The shelter team is not sure what happened in my past but I seem to get upset when I know that I need to be leashed up to go for a walk. They are working with me on more positive experiences with the leash but currently it is a work in progress. So please no children in my new home.

      "Bear is a special little dog! He is half chihuahua and has chihuahua traits, but he has very strong traits from the Tibetan Spaniel and Pekingese. All three of the breeds that make Bear up form tight bonds with their family or person. The Tibetan Spaniel often forms a worshipful bond. Bear is loyal to his person and is a great alert dog. He thinks he is a good guard dog too.  Bear takes time to warm up to strangers and remains aloof. Bear prefers to meet a stranger on his level. He is aa very intelligent dog with a huge personality. Bear needs to have an owner who has confidence and patience. He can be a little stubborn but thrives to please, he is just unsure. Bear is playful and enjoys playing with other dogs that are his size. He prefers a playmate that is a girl. If he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have another dog to play with, he is perfectly content playing with his person and a toy.  BearÃ¢ÂÂs ideal home will have only 1 or 2 other dogs his size and only 1-2 people living there. He would prefer a little quitter home in respects to the number of strangers who come and go. \n",

      "Cali is an energetic 6 year old Chihuahua/Beagle mix who is looking for an active family that can keep up with her! She weighs about 30 pounds and is full grown. Cali is a very sweet girl and can be swayed into being friends with any kind of food! She does well with men, women, and has lived with children as young as three years old. Cali has been loving being able to go out into our yards and play, play, play! She is a very spunky girl and will need a home with a securely fenced backyard. Her favorite activity is to run and would also make a great hiking buddy. Cali does great with other dogs of all sizes. She is house broken, kennel trained, knows how to use a doggy door, great on a leash and also rides well in the car. Cali is a fun loving girl but don't let her pull the wool over your eyes. She needs a strong leader to keep her moving forward with her socialization training. If you don't take the leadership role, she will. Once you have built that bond with her the sky is the limit! Cali loves to play ball, hike and hang out with dog friends. She needs someone who will put strong rules and boundaries in place so she can experience all the great things the world has to offer! Cali has been in training the past couple of weeks and is making huge strides. Her trainers are willing to meet with any potential adopter to discuss her future needs and will throw in a mini follow-up lesson for her adopters! Cali will need a home that will get her into a routine to respect boundaries and rules of the home. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and vet checked. Her adoption comes with 30 days of free pet insurance, and comes with a free vet visit. Her adoption fee is $200. To meet her, please contact her foster mom Robin at 480-326-7172.\n",

      "This petite girl is 2 year old Abby. Abby found herself at the County shelter with severe injuries to her head and neck, including a badly fractured jaw. She also had a urinary tract infection. Her injuries bear evidence of an attack by a larger animal. She had many puncture wounds, and her face was very swollen. The fracture prevents her from eating properly, and was causing her a lot of pain. She is still under medical care until that jaw of hers heals completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since feeling much better, AbbyÃ¢ÂÂs true personality has shown through. She is now a playful, happy and loving little girl and her foster momma works hard to teach Abby all kinds of things. For instance Abby is kennel trained and house trained to the door. Abby will be doggie door trained once sheÃ¢ÂÂs allowed to lose that tire-cone. She gets along well with boy dogs her size and her foster momÃ¢ÂÂs cat. She has learned to like the Ã¢ÂÂbossÃ¢ÂÂ dog who is 12. Abby knows sit, off, and no-bark. Right now sheÃ¢ÂÂs learning other commands such as place and she will be starting obedience lessons soon. Abby is loyal and loves her people and is happy just to be around them. Little Abby was (understandably) anxious when she was first brought in but has come a long way to be a happy girl.\n",

      "Brooklyn and Shane are a mismatched pair looking for their forever home together! Brooklyn is a 7 year old Chihuahua mix that weighs 18.9 pounds full grown. Shane is a 5 year old Maltese/ Yorkie mix that weighs just over 11 pounds full grown. They are a sweet pair that like to take it slow when meeting new people. Shane is the more out going of the two and will let Brooklyn know when people are friends and not food! Brooklyn knows exactly what and when she wants things. She loves getting pets and doing her own thing. They are both great with dogs of all sizes. Shane loves all people of all ages but Brooklyn can be selective of men when she first meets them. They would do best in a home with older children that will understand Brooklyn's boundaries. Both Brooklyn and Shane are house broken, walk good on leashes and ride well in the car. They both have a number of tricks that they will do for the right price. Brooklyn and Shane would love a home with a securely fenced back yard! They are altered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, vet checked. Their adoption fee is $350 and includes a free vet visit and 30 days of free pet insurance. To meet them, come to our location at 1102 W. Hatcher Road in Phoenix 85021, open Tues-Sunday 11am to 6pm. On weekends, call for location as some of our dogs attend off site adoption events, 602-944-2440\n",

Several neighbors kept food and water out for them but no one could catch them,  One day one very special young lady noticed one of the pups was missing.  She decided that she couldn't let the other one stay out in the streets alone so she tricked him into her car and took him home.  She kept her eye on the local shelters lost and found, and there Baby Girl was!!  So this sweet young lady adopted Baby Girl so she could bring her back to be with Spot.  She is unable to keep them forever because she has another dog with special needs but is fostering until a perfect forever home is found.  \n",

      "Meet Penny Lane! Penny is approximately three years old and has had one heck of a go at it ?.  Penny Lane was first discovered on Thornton Road in Stockton, when our Director was leaving a volunteerÃ¢ÂÂs home and saw Penny, her brother and mother running frantically in and out of traffic on the busy intersection of Eight Mile and Thornton Roads in Stockton. We tried to get them into the car, but they were terrified and would stop for no one. The effoYes went on for what felt like eternity, but making no progress and worried we were going to help them get if we kept pursing them. We went to Facebook for assistance and notification with their pictures and story, before long several rescue friends were setting traps and trying to corral the little family. It appears they were dumped as they stayed in this same area panicking and was so difficult to watch. Over the course of two weeks; Penny's mother was the first to be hit and killed. A week or so later, her brother would be hit and killed. Penny would sit next to her brother's body on the side of the road waiting with him. It was agonizing to watch and be so helpless. We put off calling Animal Control for his body because the rescue team was setting traps and were afraid she'd leave the area if she was alone. Night after night efforts to trap her or gain her trust weÃ¢ÂÂre futile. She was VERY afraid and didn't even THINK about coming near ANYONE. The poor dear, whatever she'd been through it was awful.  Then finally, one day, the thing we'd been dreading happened. Penny was hit by a car. It was a bad hit in that her leg injuries were so extensive amputation was considered. Those who'd been setting traps discovered she'd been hit and raced her to the vet. She was hospitalized for months having surgeries, and pins in her leg as it was shattered in several places. Cold laser therapy, antibiotics you name it. Penny was very scared. A sweet woman who'd been involved in trying to capture, would visit her almost every day at the pet hospital. She kept Penny's spirits up, helped to calm her and opened the door to human contact.  Penny was very untrusting... whatever contact she'd had prior to humans was NOT good. The time came when Penny was ready for discharge from the hosptial but would still need to come a minimum of once a week for a cold laser therapy appointment. Now that she was ready to be discharged, what to do with the little broken hearted thing.  A friend of ours who lives in a retirement park in Rancho Murieta was touched by Penny's story and offered to foster her. Penny's social progress was very slow but she was beginning to trust her foster mom. Several months went by when her foster mom was diagnosed with a disease and requires oxygen 24/7 and it was too much for her.  The foster's good friend had a little dog too and the two dogs got along famously. They became fast friends and her friend decided she would foster Penny. After a short period of time her new foster had decided to keep Penny. Many, many months passed and all the animals were getting along well. The cats and dogs were all living in harmony. Until....someone told the retirement park management, Penny's new foster/adoptive mom was over the limit on pets and now is unable to keep her. Her foster is sick over it, as it just breaks all of our hearts. Penny has become family, and she deserves the best home we can find. Penny will prefer a quiet home with maybe a friendly small dog or cat. She will need a home where someone is home during the day. She will follow her person all around and wants to be near. Her leg works when she walks slowly, but when she runs she holds it in a way that it's not touching the ground. She is much better socialized now and often will approach a stranger in a safe environment with some coaxing.   Penny needs love and patience and is looking for someone who needs her as much as she needs them. Penny would be happiest with a retired woman or couple with a softer spoken man. Loud/large men and children make her nervous. Penny does not growl or bite. She is an excellent t watch dog and no one will startle you while sheÃ¢ÂÂs around. Do you think youÃ¢ÂÂre a match for Penny? Penny is pee pee pad trained and is an indoor only dog,!except for potty breaks and requires a secure fenced yard. \n",

      "Whisky is a great lap dog or exercise partner. She loves other dogs, cats, and kids. She is a little nervous at first, but once she warms up to you she will never leave your side. This is Whisky. Whisky is a chihuahua rescued from the Fresno SPCA. She is perhaps 4 years oldish. She is generally low keyed, but can be a good watch dog. I wouldn't necessarily recommend her for families with small children, but I wouldn't call her nippy either. She is simply just a cute little girl, with a sweet heart. This is an indoor dog. We do not believe in adopting to homes that will leave the dog outside all of the time. Since we have a high volume of dogs we cannot offer details on every dog. We do not know how our dogs react with children or cats as we do not test them. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE A HOUSE TRAINED DOG. Please be ready to train your new family member where to potty! Crate training is recommended. Please ask us if you need help. Adoption fees range from $150-$300 and are not negotiable. We accept cash, check, or credit card. Please email us and let us know you want to meet this dog at Petsmart in Fresno, 3220 W Shaw Ave on Saturday or Sunday from 11a-4pm. We are non paid volunteers that have full time jobs and CANNOT meet during the week. We do not bring the same dogs to the store every weekend so you must let us know when you plan on coming so we know to bring the dog you are interested in. We do not know the exact breed on the dogs, we are just guessing. If you have a pool, please be prepared to build a fence around it. We do not want the dog to drown.\n",

Everything's coming up roses for radiant little Mimi, the happiest, busiest miss around. Curious and playful, she scampers from room to room in her foster home checking in on her fosters and her furry foster sibs, then running and wrestling with them for hours. A great fan of toys, she also enjoys walks, walking well on leash, and is ecstatic when walk time approaches. Housetrained to use the doggy door, she uses pee pads inside, and will be an ideal addition to an active home with a fenced yard that will keep her well loved and well exercised always.

      "Hi! My name is Noelle. I am 16 weeks old and weigh less than 9 pounds. I am a small pup that loves to have my belly rubbed (a lot)! My mom is a terrier mix and my dad is a chihuahua mix. They both only weigh 15 lbs so I will not be big at all. I'm a little bigger than my sister and will probably be around 10-15 pounds when I'm fully grown. I am already spayed, have a microchip, and up-to-date on my shots. I love other gentle dogs, big or small, and I don't really care about cats. I love everybody and always come running when my foster mom calls me. I am very curious and like to chase the leaves and grasshoppers in the yard.\n",

I have been sleeping at night with one of my siblings and might get lonely by myself at first so please be patient with me. I love to play with squeaky, stuffy toys and age appropriate bones to chew on. Since I am so young, I really am like a small child. I like to eat, play, and sleep a lot!

Just prior to his antipated eligible adoption date, Hubert was diagnosed with a significant pulmonic hypertension (January, 2019). A follow-up echocardiogram was completed in April, 2019, that recorded regular heart rhythm, no murmurs or gallops. The working status of Hubert's heart signficantly improved with his growth (it is not believed that Hubert will require surgery), but he is noted as having continued hypertension attributed to an underloaded left ventricle.

      "Sweet Ginger is a beautiful Chihuahua/Jack Russell. At around 6 years young, she weighs about 16 pounds ( a bit overweight) and has mostly brown and white coloring. Ginger has the most amazing pointy ears that are eager to listen to directions, a good story and she is definitely ready for a scratch in her just right spot! Ginger is very photogenic and loves to pose for the camera, as well as onlookers. She enjoys taking in the world and meeting new human friends. Ginger resided with 5 other dogs in her southern foster home and got along great with all of them! We are not sure what Gingers feelings are towards cats yet. Ginger has a typical Chihuahua personality. She is a lady who knows what she likes and doesnt like! She loves her 'person' so much, that she tends to 'protect' them from everyone else. As a result, the perfect home for Ginger will be one who is experienced with chihuahuas and/or this type of behavior and is confident in telling her she's not in charge. With some firm but kind redirection and positive reinforcement Ginger will learn fast.As a matter of fact, Ginger is already house, create and leash trained. Plus, she already knows the command to sit. She is a very easy dog to care for and love.Ginger has had lots of experience with a family who took care of her and she cant wait to meet her next family to spend her very long retirement years with. Ginger is ready for a family to call her own, to pamper her, care for her and give her lots and lots of love! She is more than ready to return all that love right back to you!The fee for adoption is $450. This includes spay/neuter, vaccinations and transport fees. Ginger is up to date on all vaccinations. Interested in adopting Ginger? To get the ball rolling head over to http://www.dogstarrescue.org/the-form/ and submit your application today. A Dog Star representative will contact you within 24 hours. To help speed up the process, please call your vet and give them permission to speak with us.If you do not get a response within 24 hours of submitting your application, please check your spam folder.\n",

      "Hello! I am a very shy, introverted little guy looking for a calm, zen, family that enjoys just hanging out. I am considered an Operation Chicken Little dog where I have been getting some extra loving and socializing with more volunteers to help me come out of my shell. I need a patient and understanding family to give me a new look at life! I would prefer to be the only pet. Operation Chicken Little is a program that was developed to help TJO dogs that are extremely scared and shut down in our adoption center. A shelter can be a scary and overwhelming place...especially for small dogs. Just because they are scared, does NOT mean they have been abused. Some dogs are naturally timid or shy, while others may not have learned to trust people while they were young. This fearful behavior may or may not continue in a home environment. Operation Chicken Little dogs may exhibit fear in any of the following ways: - Avoiding, hiding, cowering, and trembling - Slow to interact and trust new people - May growl, snap, or even bite if pushed to interact too quickly How to meet an Operation Chicken Little dog: - COMPLETELY IGNORE THE DOG AT FIRST (No looking, no talking, no touching) - Let the dog come to you and sniff you...DO NOT REACH FOR THE DOG - Give them a chance to get comfortable before attempting to pet them, SLOW AND EASY PETS Ideal home for Operation Chicken Little dogs: - Adult only or older pet savvy kids - Zen type home: quiet/low traffic/low stress - Confident and gentle resident dogs are a possibility - Fear of new people and new environments make these dogs best suited as homebodies Operation Chicken Little dogs will thrive in a home with loving, patient, and calm people. TJO will provide guidelines that assist in the transition to a new home. These guidelines will ensure the safety of the pet, family, and visitors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Buttercup is an adorable, easy going dog who only ever wants to be beside you (she sticks to me like velcro - it's the cutest thing!) Her favorite things include lounging around, ear scratches, and cheese.She's also pee pad trained!!!I think she'd be perfect for a low to mid energy home. She does get sad when I leave for work, so potentially a multi-person household (where there's usually someone to hang her) with would be perfect! She has no issue with strangers - she's mindful of new faces, but will cozy up quick and won't be hesitant to ask for cuddles! She doesn't mind my dog, but prefers to do her own thing - so I think another low-energy (and/or) older pets would be totally fine. I do think she's still very timid and getting used to NYC - she's wary of going outside and the kennel, but I think with time and patience she'll blossom. Ultimately she's a low maintenance dog who just wants to be your best bud. I have she'll captivate the heart of anyone who meets her.\n",

      " \n",
      "When your application is received we process by reviewing all references and then setting up your conference or meeting with the foster family after those references have been checked.    Because our foster families volunteer to open their hearts and homes to our rescues, we try to lessen the amount of interference with their lives by only allowing pre-approved adopters to meet the dog and/or call the foster family to ask questions about the dog.   The pre-approval process does not obligate you and would NOT require a home visit until you have spoken with or met with the foster family to be sure the dog is right for you.   Once that occurs and you are committed to adopting our rescue, then we will schedule your home visit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "PLEASE NOTE:  SOME DOGS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR A MEET AND GREET.  Because we are a foster based rescue, our rescues are transported to our foster families AFTER they have been vetted and are cleared for transport medically.  Although our company has headquarters in New Jersey and our second location in Mass, where they end up being fostered depends on which foster is available at that time (our pet finder site only allows us to post in New Jersey or Mass, not where dogs are fostered).   Our foster team members are located from North Carolina all the way to Southern Maine.  IF THEY ARE BEING FOSTERED OUTSIDE OF THE AREA THAT YOU COULD EASILY TRAVEL TO, we arrange for you to speak with the foster to determine if the dog is what you are expecting.  So, if the dogs are not being fostered close enough to visit prior to adoption and this is not acceptable to you, please do not fill out an application. \n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases our rescues are adopted directly from their vetting and quarantine and do not even get to foster.  Many families are comfortable for a direct adoption, especially with puppies or with the evaluation provided by our references and our rescue trainer.   In this case they are transported to the adopter and our adoption contract provides for a thirty day refund of your adoption fee for any reason.   The dog is returned to us if they are not working and it cannot be resolved to yours and to our satisfaction. \n",
      "\n",
      "From this point, with all information on the application being acceptable and the home visit satisfactory,  the applicant is approved and the adoption takes place.  Your contracts are emailed and your adoption fee will be $350 (that includes all medical and transport fees).   Once contracts are signed and your adoption fee paid,  arrangements are made to transport the dog to his/her home, whether it be from a foster or from our vet clinic.  \n",

      "Beyond the thirty refund policy in our adoption contract, Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. offers a lifetime guarantee on all of its animals.

She is fine with other dogs and cats.  She is a snuggler and always wanting to be where you are, she stays close. She is also very accepting of being left alone occasionally for 2 or 3 hours, and at those times she has the run of the kitchen or sleeps in her crate with the door open.  She happily stays in her crate with the door closed when activity in the house becomes too stimulating. \n",

      "Hi! My name is Bolt! Please read my bio below!\n",
      "\n",
      "Weight and Age: I am a whopping 10 pounds and am 1 year old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: I was found on the side of the road when I was 8 weeks old by a woman who picked me up and took me home. She worked long hours but thought she wanted to keep me. Unfortunately when I turned 10 months she decided she couldn't afford another dog so she brought me to the rescue. The ladies at the rescue immediately fell in love with me as I am super sweet! I lived a very secluded life with my finder so I was very fearful of even going for a walk on a leash at first. But now...I LOVE IT! I also love my foster dog siblings and bond with new women very quickly! I would probably do best in a home with mainly women or even just one woman as I have a hard time bonding with men. I'm not mean but I get scared and won't come up to them. My foster mom says I am so easy at the house and am potty trained and very polite! I can't wait for my new family to adopt me!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical Status: I am  now neutered, micro-chipped, up to date on shots,  and current on heartworm and flea preventatives. I have no other health issues and am heart worm negative. YAY!\n",
      "\n",
      "Activity level: I am fairly active and love to be doing things but I can settle down and cuddle with her as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potty Training/Crate Training: I am both thanks to my foster mom! I never have an accident in my kennel anymore and only had a couple accidents when I was first found in the house. I can get nervous in new situations so I might have an accident at first but once I feel safe IÃ¢ÂÂll be just fine!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Animals: I am good with other dogs of all sizes and love to chase and be chased! I do not have a dominant personality so I am often used for temperament testing for the new dogs that are brought into the rescue and I take my job very seriously! I would probably be good with a cat and never payed them much mind at the clinic I go to for checkups and they wander all over the place. IÃ¢ÂÂm mainly curious but then I know how to mind my own business.\n",
      " \n",
      "Special Needs: I can be fearful of men when I first meet them and I donÃ¢ÂÂt know that I would ever be best friends with one. I would love a more female oriented household as I bond the quickest and easiest with the ladies!\n",

I am so thankful to be given a chance to be adopted by someone who will love me and give me hugs and kisses like my foster Mom. Due to my abusive past, I don't like for someone to look me directly in my eyes while holding me as it scares me. When my foster Mom would do this, I would smile at her showing my teeth. I would not bite and have no bite history, but that's how I showed I was nervous. After a couple of months, I learned my foster Mom would never hurt me and I replaced my smiles with lots of licking and kissing my foster Mom; and now I smile with my eyes. I have never known love or how good life could be.\n",

      "Hi, I'm Miss Dixie, a 3 year old 7 lb Chihuahua mix. Life's been tough for me, so I am pretty timid and scared. I'll need someone who understands I'm a little special and I need some time to warm up, but once the ice is broken, you'll be the center of my world. I am happy to live in a multi-pet househould (other dogs would probably make me happy!) but kids make me nervous, so any kids around would need to be very dog respectful - maybe older kids are better. I am working very hard on house training and I am great on a leash. One thing I LOVE is treats. I think I'd be happier outside the city so I could have a calm environment. \n",

Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment.

      "My name is BELLARINA and I'm a darling 2 yr F White Chihuahua/Maltese/Terrier X. I'm 10 lbs of PURE SCRUFFY SWEETNESS. I was rescued along with my sister BLANCA but we are very different. I'm very shy and nervous when meeting new people and am very vocal but once I get to know you I am open and friendly... but I'm not fond of people I don't know looking at me or trying to touch me. I'm very insecure and fearful. I'm fine with dogs and cats and ideally would love to be with my sister or another dog because I'm much more comfortable with other dogs and much more confident when I'm with another dog and I love big dogs!!. Since I'm skittish, it's best that I go with older children ages 12 yrs +. It's best that I go to a home in the country with a yard rather than an apt building because the city just makes me too nervous. I need a quiet home with another dog to play with!. I'm quite the friendly darling bud once I warm up and know and trust you. I could use some help with housebreaking as I still do my business on wee wee pads and I also need help with leash training as I do zig zag on walks. I'll be a great companion once I get into a daily routine and am with someone patient and compassionate and willing to give me the TLC I need to be a more balanced, confident dog.

      "Little LucyÃ¢ÂÂs rescue tale is extra heartbreakingÃ¢ÂÂ¦ she was found in Louisiana in December, living in an outdoor kennel with her deceased canine companion.  Lucy was starving and her only shelter from the elements was an old childÃ¢ÂÂs plastic play kitchen.  Since being rescued, Lucy has gained weight, lost the worried look on her face, and enjoys getting hugs and kisses from her foster family.  Lucy is estimated to be 5 years old.  She weighs 14# and we think she is a Chihuahua x Rat Terrier mix.  Her foster mom says, Ã¢ÂÂLucy is sweet, lovable, cute, little, eager to please, and has a tail that never stops wagging. She wants to be loved and wants to make everyone her friend. But she is very careful about who she chooses to trust.  She can still be shy and sensitive at times.  She does not do very well with loud voices or noises. She does not like to be corrected and will run and hide if she hears a \\\"No.\\\" Even if it directed at another dog or human in the house.Ã¢ÂÂ  Lucy is housetrained and crated trained.  She does well with the cats in her foster home.  She is excellent with the male dogs in her home but sometimes their female chihuahua likes to start fights with Lucy, so she would likely do best as an only dog or with brothers.  LucyÃ¢ÂÂs foster mom says she would prefer a Ã¢ÂÂcalm, quiet family. Maybe an older person or couple. She wants to spend the days on someone's lap watching TV or napping.Ã¢ÂÂ  Hurry and apply for this special little girl who deserves to spend the rest of her days feeling safe and loved after what she has lived through!  Only good things from here on out for our little Lucy! Please email us at TheChiSociety@gmail.com to apply for this four legged angel!\n",

      "- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dogÃ¢ÂÂs physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Currently we do not have a physical shelter to visit our animals. Our expected opening will be in February-March 2019. Our dogs/puppies are either in foster care or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n",

      "Sophie-Pearl is a 14lb and 4yr old sweet cuddly dog, very friendly toward adults and likes kids. Quiet with company, and a great dog to relax with. Has slight separation anxiety, not good with crates. Better when able to roam around the house, Timid with other dogs and cats; but lives well with them. She was recently house trained with seldom accidents and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt use pee pads. Slight food aggression: will get aggressive if you take food out of her mouth, put hand in bowl, if you leave food within her reach- she will eat it. (This is being worked on with Sophie's foster.) Will get into trash can and eat scraps/paper towels(solution is tall trash cans and closing the bathroom doors). Smart dogs like her who are mischievous with trash cans etc, can do great with agility training, lots of mental stimulus and outdoor activities/ lots of exercise.\n",

      "Hi My name is TAZ and I'm a darling 1.5y M Tan/White Chihuahua/Terrier X. I am 8 lbs of PURE HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY! I was rescued from a home where I was crated 90% of the time and neglected. I was skinny, my nails were curling into my pads and I was a completely terrified of everything. Now that I've been in a foster home I'm starting to become more sociable and more comfortable in my skin. I'm a sweet silly lively little guy! I'm very happy go lucky and very active and can be a bit of a spaz! I am almost housebroken but I do go on pads inside and getting better doing my business outside. I'm being fostered with another dog and we are buds. I am fine with dogs on the street but do get a little nervous with bigger dogs and can be vocal with them.  I lived with cats so I don't care about them. Since I'm still skittish, it's best I go with older kids ages 12 yrs +. I can be very vocal in the home when someone is at the door or I hear noises in the hallway. I'm crate trained and ok on the leash but could use a bit more basic training. My favorite thing is to snuggle with you and do zoomies on the couch! (see video). I'm a wonderful silly sweet little guy but I'm a typical little big guy chihuahua so I would love to go with someone that knows, understands & appreciates my breed and I would love to be with a doggie playmate that can match my active kinetic energy! \n",

      "Anndalina**** Anndalina is part of our TLC program. Our TLC club members receive special follow-up help when adopted into their new home including visits with a professional behaviorist. Speak to our volunteers about more information regarding our TLC members.****5 year old female, chi mix. black with white, no kids, okay with some dogs, basics of potty training.Anndalina came to us as an emergency surrender. This poor girl was trying to chew her tail off and needed emergency treatment. We rushed her into our vet and it was determined her tail would need to be amputated to prevent any infection from spreading. This poor nervous girl was whisked into surgery and brought back to one of our foster homes. Anndalina has had a rough beginning to her life and she will need a patient and understanding home to help her become the dog we know she can be. We would recommend she go to a child free home and a home where her Chihuahua bark will not be a problem. A nice quiet couple or single person would be the ideal place for her as she can become overwhelmed with too many visitors. Once she bonds to her people she is very affectionate but it will take a while for this nervous girl to settle into any new home and she will need to be given time to calm and adjust.Please note we do not have a central kennel facility, all of our pets are located in foster homes. The first step in meeting one of our furry friends is to fill out an application on our website at <a href='www.rainbowrescues.org'>www.rainbowrescues.org</a>. A volunteer will be in contact with you in 1-2 business days to review your application and speak with you about the adoption process. Our adoption fees at this time are $250 for Adult dogs, $300 for puppies (6 months and under), $100 for senior dogs, $100 for cats, and a $50 fee for small animals. **Please be aware that we are not responsible for inaccurate information on some cross-posted sites such as inaccurate adoption fees and inaccurate pet info.**\n",

      "These two are the definition of unconditional love. Together, they quietly follow their foster mom and family around, wagging their tails. Princess (light hair, 10 yrs., 6 pounds) makes tiny hops of joy when she is happy, particularly when playing with her stuffed toys. Bleu (dark hair, 12 yrs., 7 pounds) is delighted when someone is petting him. Their favorite thing to do, however, is to snuggle in a warm lap, and since they are so small, they can both fit in a single lap! They are exceptionally calm and affectionate. They are housebroken and crate trained, friendly with kids and dogs, and filled to the brim with love. They were raised together, always watch out for each other, and are beautiful companions for life, so they must be adopted together.\n",

I'm house trained and keen to learn new commands. I'm also fearless and very protective of my owner, which is quite a surprise to bigger dogs and even some people, so best to introduce me carefully. However, once I'm used to people or other dogs, I warm up quickly to them. I can get nervous when I'm left alone, so I hope my new family will work with me in overcoming this.

      "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.This adorable little guy has not had a good life so far and we are hoping that he gets someone this time around who will love him for his good personality and eyes that can look right into your soul. Buddy is happy and friendly but can be shy at first. He gets along well with other dogs and did fine on his cat test. He does not know how to walk on a leash but loves to be held and carried. He was born to be snuggled and loved, but found himself with people who didn't really want him. If you will hold him and tell him the bad old days are over, he will be forever grateful and will respond by snuggling against your chest, sighing with relief, and then letting you know in every way he can how much he will love you back, all of his life. He wants so much to show you what a good little boy he can be. We have made sure he has been completely vetted and has all his shots. He is ready for you!If you are interested in Tiny Buddy, please contact:\n",

      "Please visit our webpage: http://www.masrescue.org/DogApplication.pdf to complete the adoption application online or go to http://www.masrescue.org/pnp.html for more details on adoption through MAS Rescue. Adoption fee is $300.00. We understand the desire to meet our \\\"cuties\\\" as soon as possible. But because we operate entirely out of foster homes, we need to limit visitation to approved applicants only. Once your application is completed by you and approved by MASR, we will be glad to schedule your visit. We do NOT guarantee Ã¢ÂÂhousebroken.Ã¢ÂÂ  If the animal is listed as housebroken it is because he/she has not had accidents for a period of time moving forward in the foster home.  Some animals may regress during the transition to a new home which is why we do not provide a guarantee.  Patience and consistency is always key. \n",
      "Please Note: 100% of all the adoption fees collected are used to care for the animals, and pay our ever increasing vet bill. This dog has been examined by our vet, spayed or neutered (if not previously done), vaccinations updated, heartworm negative, and has been microchipped. We appreciate your interest in adopting from a rescue organization.\n",
      "ATTENTION:  Beginning June 30th, 2017, MAS Rescue will charge a $10 non refundable administrative application processing fee.  100% of this fee will be for our rescued animals in need.  To be clear:  1.  No dog application will be processed until the $10 fee is paid via PayPal link on our website: http://www.masrescue.org/helpus.html.\n",
      "2.  The $10 is non refundable.  Should you be approved and adopt an animal through MAS Rescue, you will receive a $10 credit to your adoption fee.\n",
      "3.  Paying the application fee is in no way a guarantee that you will be approved to adopt an animal through MAS Rescue.  All of the same standards in processing applications still apply.  See our policies and procedures: http://www.masrescue.org/pnp.html\n",
      "4.  By submitting an application and paying the $10 application fee, you agree to the terms listed above.  If you do not adopt through MAS Rescue or your application is rejected, this serves as your notice of the application fee policy.\n",

      "Breed Selection is 'Best Efforts' given by shelter staff, veterinarians and rescue volunteers. NO guarantees are implied. Please note that small breeds are not well designed for families with young children as everything about them is more delicate and will require careful handling.\n",

      "Muppet Max makes Oprah a verb. Now that he is living in a foster home he is living his best life everyday. You have never met a dog who loves life more than this little man. This crazy looking guy is about 8-10 years old and 20 lbs. He is very friendly and good with other pups. He goes to the dog park every day and with his weight loss gets more engaged with the other pups all the time. He loves to pay ref when his big foster sister wrestles. Max would be a great first dog for someone in an apartment. He is quiet, clean and loves to snuggle. He is easy going with dogs and cats and has approached kids with enthusiasm. Max is great on a leash and is very gentle when walking. He would be an excellent choice for a Senior who wants a companion or a someone younger who would prefer walks instead of runs.\n",

Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and flag any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n",

      "Please visit our webpage http://www.masrescue.org/DogApplication.pdf to complete the adoption application online or go to http://www.masrescue.org/pnp.html for more details on adoption through MAS Rescue. Adoption fee is $300.00.  We understand the desire to meet our \\\"cuties\\\" as soon as possible. But because we operate entirely out of foster homes, we need to limit visitation to approved applicants only. Once your application is completed by you and approved by MASR, we will be glad to schedule your visit.  We do NOT guarantee Ã¢ÂÂhousebroken.Ã¢ÂÂ  If the animal is listed as housebroken it is because he/she has not had accidents for a period of time moving forward in the foster home.  Some animals may regress during the transition to a new home which is why we do not provide a guarantee.  Patience and consistency is always key. ATTENTION:  Beginning June 30th, 2017, MAS Rescue will charge a $10 non refundable administrative application processing fee.  100% of this fee will be for our rescued animals in need.  To be clear:  1.  No dog application will be processed until the $10 fee is paid via PayPal link on our website: http://www.masrescue.org/helpus.html.\n",
      "2.  The $10 is non refundable.  Should you be approved and adopt an animal through MAS Rescue, you will receive a $10 credit to your adoption fee.\n",

      "Amber is a survivor! Also known as Slink and Squeak, she survived Parvo when all odds were against her...but she rallied and is now a spunky and quirky little girl. She definitely has loads of personality! She is dog friendly, but would do best as an only dog in the home as she does protect her space from other dogs, but is fine with humans. She is fine with other dogs as long as they aren't trying to take over her space. She is well crate trained and will go to her crate and hang out in her comfort zone, enjoys sleeping on the big bed under the covers, and her favorite thing in the world is to give kisses! She is an uber-snuggler, she is active but not over the top. She is definitely a unique little girl that you must understand and just laugh at her quirks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dog Friendly, YES, but best as an only dog because she does protect her space (crate, bed, food, toys) but is perfectly fine if I walk up and take something from her. She does not attack another dog, but she does charge them and grow and bark at them to fend them off. She is SUPER SWEET and friendly outside of her space. If you understand and love the quirks of a Chihuahua, then this gal will keep you laughing and loving for many years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n",

      "Meet Kardi. This little lady was surrendered an overcrowded rural shelter because her owners were moving and reported that they were unable to take her with them. As a result, she is searching for her new forever family. Perhaps, it's you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kardi is a sweet and loving girl. She's been in a foster home while under the care of the shelter and her foster mom describes her as a \\\"nut\\\" and a happy girl. She absolutely loves playing with the other dogs in the home. When she first arrived, she was scared of the bigger dogs but within a few days, she had settled in and now runs around the yard wrestling with them. She also shared a foster home in SC with Ellie. She loves playing with her. Kardi also loves water. She wants to jump in her foster's pool and also enjoys long walks in the rain. She's housebroken and cratetrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 8/25/19 - Kardi arrived in town and is enjoying her new foster home. She's being fostered with cats, and multiple other small dogs and enjoys playing and romping around the yard with them. Kardi loves children, and gives lots of kisses! When she met her foster mom's 2 grandkids (12 & 14) she followed them everywhere, and really enjoyed their company. She initially showed food guarding issues a few times at mealtime in her foster home, but that has since abated. Still we feel she's best in a home with kids out of the toddler stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her foster mom thinks she would really enjoy a family with another playful dog and a couple of children to hang out with. She'll make a great family dog. Crate trained, housebroken, and good with dogs and cats too!\n",

      "People often ask if we know their new dogÃ¢ÂÂs history, and we usually donÃ¢ÂÂt.  Rebel is different, though.  A lady drove up to our rescue with two dogs and a litter of newborn puppies in her car.  She told us that she no longer had a home and could no longer keep the dogs.  She asked that we take the dogs, and, of course, we did.  Rebel is one of them.

It's not surprising that she also has some separation anxiety. She has 2 brothers in her foster home that she snuggles with but they are boring and don't like to play. She likes to play tag with the cats even though they are not a fan of this game. She loves car rides and day trips, will sit at a festival and watch the music and is pretty fearless except to be put on her back, that's a firm NO!

      "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Small Freddie has not had a good life so far. We don't understand how anyone could beat such an innocent little guy, but the way he flinches when a hand hovers over him really tells his story. We are hoping for a kind, gentle person, who will show Freddie that all people don't hurt. His foster says of him 'This precious scared boy we feel may have been abused so it will take time for him to feel safe. He has made small steps with his foster. She is now able to pet him and he's trying to play with her. When she tries to pet or touch him behind his head he gets scared. His crate is his safe place. I would say a very quiet calm home with only older children would be good for him.' We will require a physical fence for his new home so he can play safely. Freddie is such a deserving little guy and has so much potential. We just want him to know what it's like to be loved. Imagine your joy when he looks to YOU the first time he is unsure. Think about watching him playing happily, prancing across your livingroom floor. You will get to see so many of his firsts! His tiny heart is just waiting for you to show him a happy world.We had trouble figuring out what breed Freddie is, so we had a DNA test done. Here are the results: 37.5% Chihuahua, 12.5% Lab, 12.5%, Miniature Poodle, 12.5% Miniature Schnauzer, 25% other groups herding like Australian cattle dog, companion like Pom or Pug or Keeshond, and Middle Eastern group like Basenji!If you are interested in Freddie, please contact:\n",

He likes to go for walks and does very well on the leash.  He's alittle nervous about sudden moves in the foster home but getting better as he settles in.

Due to the inoperable tumor we have decided to take him off the adoption list and care for him for the rest of his days, no matter how many!

      "UPDATE 4/10/19: BUBBY underwent surgery to remove a large tumor in his abdomen today. Unfortunately it was adhered to the stomach wall and small intestine and not able to be removed. Bubby is recovering in his foster home and will be cared for as long as he is comfortable. Donations to support Bubby are gratefully appreciated and can be sent through the PayPal link on our website or care packages - supplements (dasuquin & duralactin), canned food and treats can be sent to CompAnimals 1497 Flint Hill Rd, Landenberg PA 19350 in care of Bubby and will be sent to his foster mom. Thank you! \n",

      "BUBBY is a bow-legged, cantankerous old man who came to us after the death of his owner. He has his comical moments and endearing qualities and we know there is someone out there who will love him in spite of himself! Bubby has bad knees and is on supplements and prescription meds for his arthritis - he gets around pretty well considering his anatomy! Bubby does have a big tummy due to an enlarged liver. The vet initially suspected Cushings disease however follow-up bloodwork shows that he just has elevated liver values. He will be retested again in March and we recommend checking blood work every 6 months as we do with all of our senior pups. Bubby lived with 2 other dogs who have been adopted. He would be happy as an only pup or in a home with a laid back dog that wonÃ¢ÂÂt retaliate when Bubby gets bossy. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you are the retirement home that Bubby is looking for. Excellent vet references are a must! Adoption $100. Bubby has been neutered, vaccinated and is on heartworm & flea/tick prevention.\n",

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their \\\"forever home\\\" and never have to go through a rehoming again!\n",

      "Meet Sugar :) She is an absolutely beautiful little girl who got dumped in a kill shelter when her owner died. She was rescued shaking and cowering in the corner of her cage in the big scary shelter. She is proving to be a wonderful companion in her foster home and wiggles her whole rear end when spoken to and rolls over for belly rubs. She is medium to low energy, preferring to just sit with the humans and be petted or follow you around on your chores. She is also up for a game of fetch now and then and loves to chew on nyla bones. Sugar tends to try to be queen of the castle and would do best as an only dog or with a larger dog (25lbs and over) who would not put up with her bossiness. She will play with other freindly dogs. She is spayed and microchipped and has had all her vaccinations. Fill out an application now if you think Sugar would be a good fit in your home. She is a wonderful little lady and deserves a great forever home!Please fill out an adoption application:\n",

      "Hi, my name is Molly and I am a Chi mix.  I am 4 yrs old and weigh 15 lbs.\n",
      "I came into rescue with a 75-lb sidekick, Piper the Pit Bull Mix. I boss her around, of course. We enjoy each other's company but could be adopted separately. It's been really hard to find a family that wants both a Big and a Little.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my Foster Mom:\n",
      "\n",
      "Molly is a clownish spunky little thing -- she's full of personality and is super affectionate. She doesn't show well at adoption events thanks to her wariness about new people (typical of a Chi) and her mixed-signal Napoleon-complex. While she's probably not a great fit for a home with little kids, she's great with our 12-year old granddaughter. Molly is quite spry on level ground and in the house -- but more than a few stairs is going to be hard for her (we have a single-level home). She has a funny gait -- it's been likened to a Monty Python silly walk -- and when she runs through the house it sounds like a herd of Chihuahuas! She has been one of our easier fosters and is really intuitive about what's going on the house. When I put on my logo rescue T-shirt, she gets all excited because she knows someone is about to go on an outing! We love her dearly and have done our job to get her healthy and ready for her forever home. We are in the DC-metro area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about meÃ¢ÂÂ¦..\n",
      "I'm a shoe thief! I don't really chew on them -- I just like to carry them around and leave them about the house. My foster mom thinks it's hilarious, except when it's one of hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently I'm a good communicator. I can tell you when it's dinnertime, or when I want to get picked up on the couch, or when it's time to go outside to chase a pesky squirrel. I love watching the backyard through the glass door and could spend hours out there sniffing around (I'm ALL dog!). I'm really good about doing my wet business out there -- but occasionally I get distracted and forget to poop until I'm back inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I adore my foster people, but I'm slow to warm to new people, so a new family needs to be patient to let me adjust. I can be won over with cookies (kibble) and sleeping in the bed. I don't like my ears touched but love belly rubs. I stick my cold wet nose in the back of your knee when I want you to pat me, like when you are intently working on the computer. I tend to hang out in whatever room the people are in. Except when doggie TV is on, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molly's  \\\"challenge\\\" is her initial aloofness/wariness and need for managed intros to other dogs. People with Chi experience can see past that, but she comes across very badly..  It heartbreaking, because she is SO loving in our home and she is consistent. She is so curious and smart and clownish -- highly adoptable but doesnt \\\"show\\\" well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a sad video of me when I was first surrendered to the shelter -- I'm practically bald and super itchy. I am SOOOO much better now. I eat a limited-ingredient kibble (available at pet stores) and don't get many other treats or people food, but I enthusiastically lick my foster dad's yogurt cup every morning. I'm very good about my baths -- I get one weekly with special shampoo. I also get an allergy shot (Cytopoint) every 6 - 8 weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "My back knees are a bit wonky and my legs are REALLY short, so stairs are trouble for me, but I can bound across the grass after those bunnies and chipmunks. I enjoy walks in the neighborhood, too, but probably won't go on 5-mile hikes unless you carry me in a pouch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really vocal when I meet a new dog, but can be persuaded to hang, it just takes some time. The shelter said I'm okay with cats. I was really interested (in a nice way) in some I saw at an adoption event, but my foster mom hasn't tested me with cats.\n",

Her foster home consists of seven dogs and she has growled at all of them at one time or another. She has also snapped at three of them. After being with them a couple months she has settled in and now will play with most of the other dogs. She is food aggressive and that may be due to what she endured while living on the street. She is housebroken and we are working on leash training. \n",

      "Charlotte is diabetic and it is under control with the least expensive insulin. She likes to snuggle and be under the blankets. She would make a very good companion for a person or couple with one or no other pets. She is good with younger children. She has taught herself how to climb up and down stairs and is a very bright girl! Her favorite thing to do is lay in your arms like a baby and have her belly rubbed, she could do that for hours!

Bruiser seeks out affection from his foster mom, and he loves every child that he meets.  We really hope that someone gives our wonderful boy, Bruiser, the chance of being part of their family! \n",
      "(10/24/18)    Bruiser has settled in easily to his new foster home. He is a very happy boy who loves to go for walks anywhere. At home he is happy to lay around or next to you on the couch. A good bone to chew is always enjoyed. He is just fine living with other dogs and cats however when out on a leash he sometimes needs a slow introduction to other dogs (if he is really excited). He is also great with kids and babies. Fine with adults too. Who canÃ¢ÂÂt love those ears! He is a nice 16lb. size and about 8yrs old.  (3/7/18) Bruiser is a happy boy who will be a great addition to a loving family once he has time to settle in and feel safe. He gets along great with other dogs and just loves his foster parents! He would do best with an active family who will play with him and take him for lots of walks.  :-) BRUISER WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU!

      "Trixie came to us as a stray, very skinny and shy from a shelter in Alabama. We estimate her date of birth to be around 3/1/2019. She is about 20 pounds at around 6 months old. We are totally guessing on breeds for her. She will stay on the small to medium size. She is shorter and stocky and does have perky ears and short tail. So there is a possiblity she may have some pit, pug or bulldog mixed with Chihuahua would be our best guess. Trixie is shy at first, but super friendly and playful once she gets to know you. We are recommending a calmerhome for her that likes to go for walks or has another friendly dog for her to play with. She may hide if there are young children and a lot of noises will scare her. She does need house training yet, but does well so far with paper.Trixie is now spayed, microchipped and up to date with vaccines for her age. Her adoption fee is $350.00.

      "\\\"Amelia is a loving, playful, and adorable 7-year-old chihuahua-dachsund mix. Despite her age, she has a wonderful level of energy and playfulness. She is in great health, up to date on her vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.She has consistently been friendly with every person and dog she has met. We often joke that she should run for mayor! Amelia is both housebroken and crate trained. She knows to go to the door to signal when she needs to go out and will put herself to bed in her crate at night on command (\\\"Amelia, go to bed!\\\") She will sit for treats (she is very food motivated - great news for future training!) but that also means that we have to watch her food portions and her weight.Despite her breed, Amelia is not a 'yippy' dog. She only barks when she is trying to initiate play (with people or other dogs) or occasionally when someone arrives at the door. Other than that, Amelia is not very vocal at all.She is a chewer, but only on toys. We have not had any instances of destructive chewing. Amelia loves to be outside and will regularly opt to either bask in the sun or run around the yard (either alone or with other dogs). When inside, she is typically between cuddling up on a couch and/or in her crate (we leave it open all day). When people or other dogs are around, her energy level picks up and she is quick to make her presence known and will often try to initiate play.Amelia would be a great addition to an active, attentive family. She is the perfect mix of a dog that loves to play but also loves to cuddle up on the couch at the end of the day. An ideal home would be one with some combination of older children, other dogs, and/or active adults.\\\"If you are interested in meeting Amelia or any of our other adoptables please visit joejoesplace.org and fill out an application.\n",

      "KD is a young male  approx 18 months of age and weighing 14LBS. His current foster is taking care of him after his family gave him up due to a change in their home. KD is very sweet and wants to sit in your lap and cover you with kisses. Large dogs make him nervous, but we believe KD could live with small dogs (he wants to play with them after he gets used to them), assertive cats, and children over 10 (or at foster mom's discretion). He loves to go for walks and is very smart. KD is being fostered by a dog trainer with Your Mannerly Mutt and she is offering free classes for him. KD is a little bit of a barker so no apartment living for this boy. He will also need a fenced in yard.  KD is neutered, UTD on vaccines & microchipped.

      "Cute Rylee was brought into a local high risk shelter after her last human passed away.  The shelter is a scary place for most but for a small pooch used to a home with a person that loved her, we can only imagine what went through her mind, which showed through her actions.  Rylee was acting out in the only way she knew how to protect herself, and that was trying to not allow people near her by being nippy, growly and showing big whale eyes.  She didn't stand much of a chance getting adopted that way so PLDP pulled her.  Trying not to let the same behavior start foster mom went super slow with her.  After a few days Rylee finally decided to come out of her crate with the help of her foster brother, and she continues to get braver and come out of her shell more every day.  Rylee was spayed 4/5 where she displayed the same behavior in that cage as she did in the shelter, so it's really going to take a special home to continue to build her trust in humans by slowly. Because she has a few nips under her belt, we are recommending a home with no children.   We are still learning about Rylee and she does live with other pups, but she doesn't get along with everyone, so she is dog selective, as of now.  She is also being introduced to cats and that seems to be going well.  She is not a huge fan of the crate but she is learning to go in and settle when it's bedtime.  She also uses the PP pads, and does go potty outside too.  She hasn't played too much with toys, she has picked up a tiny Kong ball a few times, so she does have it in her to have some fun, she has enjoyed chewing on bully sticks.  Our vet seemed to think she is just over 2 YO, and she weighs about 8 pounds. If you think you are a good fit for our Rylee, please go to our website www.pldpaws.org and complete an application.  Rylee is spayed, chipped, UTD and heartworm neg.  Prefer applicant live within 100 miles from PA 19029\n",

      "Q is a very unique boy. He has had a terrible past of spending his life up to the time of his rescue of living in a crate in a basement. Could you imagjne never seeing the light of day or walking and feeling the earth under your feet. Q will love his person unconditionally but he needs time to know you are his person, can you give him that time ? Q-tip or just Q is a very sweet older boy. He weighs in at 30 - 35 pounds. We think he is a chihuahua mix. At 9 years old he led a very hard life of being locked in a cage in a basement living in his own filth. What his WV foster and his PA foster have learned is that he just wants to lay on your lap in a blanket and be loved. He will lay on the back of the couch and look out the window and wait for your return, so leave the blinds up a bit so he can see. He is great on a leash. While walking, fast cars or trucks might scare him, but that is getting less and less. He likes other dogs as long if they are laid back. If the dogs are energetic and in his face he will growl and retreat for safety. He has shown bouts of play, but when it gets to high energy he panics. Cats seem to be a sense of curiosity for him and he is overly curious. If they hiss or swat and hiss at them him may begin to ignore them. He is crate trained, he might whine for less than 5 minutes but will settle after that. He loves ALL people. He no longer has a nervous shake. Do you have room in your home and heart for this special boy?\n",

      "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Sept 12 Foster Update: Will is a happy little guy who loves attention. I think he has the potential to learn many things (tricks, commands, etc). He is a quick learner and listens well. He is showing signs of crate anxiety. We have been leaving him out at night and he sleeps with the other dogs in our house in one of the dog beds. We do still feed him in the crate and while he knows that and is excited to go in there to eat, he wants out quickly once he is done. We really feel the best fit for him is a home with at least one other dog and people who are around most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster Update: Will is a real sweetheart. He was nervous the first day or so but settled in quickly with the other dogs in the household. He does best with slow movements by his human. He does tend to get a bit nervous in the crate after he eats so I do not know how he would do in it if left alone during the day. I think that he will have to go into a home with at least one other dog as he loves to pile up with two or three of the other dogs in our house and he can be a bit nervous without them. He does mark in the house occasionally but that may be from the new fosters in and out of our house. We keep him near us or in one room if we can not watch him. I do not think it will be an ongoing behavior once he is settled in a home. I was calling him \\\"Chill Will\\\" because he loves to lay on his back and nap or have his belly scratched. We believe he may be part Jack Russell. We think he will make somebody a wonderful companion!\n",

The only time they are separated is when they are eating.They have been fine with the other dogs in the household since the moment they arrived at our house.They can be a bit fearful or shy at times so I think older kids only. They were terrified of the firework noise on the Fourth of July and the same for thunderstorms. We have been putting little thundershirts on them when storms start and they actually come to us and stand still while we put them on.They still tremble and want to be comforted.

They listen extremely well and did everything I told them. Such happy, energetic little boys. Super sweet and not fearful at all. They love to explore. I have a very secure, fenced \\\"small dog\\\" play area in my back yard. They covered every square inch and had a fun game of chase with my Maggie, She's a 13 lb. Havanese. They had tons of fun.

I like to play with the toys we have up here at the Humane Society, and I like getting treats and belly rubs! I am young, but I have already had a rough life. I've been most likely hit by a car at some point in my life, and my pelvis, hips, and legs healed on their own. I will most likely have arthritis in them forever. I will also have to be fed a certain diet. I have also been shot by what appeared to be a BB or an airsoft BB, as it is embedded in my hindquarters. It would be nice to get to settle down into a loving, calm home environment with a loving furever family that will give me the peace and love I so deserve!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n",

      "Rylee is a Min Pin/Chiweenie mix who was given up by her owner because she did not have time for her.  She was delivered in a Rubbermaid tote.  Rylee is 3 years old but is still very much a puppy.  She loves to chew shoes so they must be put in a closed closet.  She is very playful and loves to wrestle with Bertram and Topper (also available for adoption at www.alcovypet.com ).  She is quiet in her crate and keeps it clean.  She's affectionate after about an hour with you.  She'll sometimes growl at strangers and barks at children, but if you sit down with her and talk to her sweetly, she will quickly warm up.  Rylee weighs about 13 lbs.  Her scruffy whiskers are so cute!  Alcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.

      "Snoopy is a goofy older gentleman. Our vet thinks Snoopy is about 10 years of age, but you would never, ever guess it when you meet him! Snoopy has lots of energy and LOVES to play and chase toys and have fun for as long as the day has hours. You may laugh at how his pictures seem to be all be at about the same angle - that's because he's quite difficult to get pictures of him where's NOT a blur of happy pinballing around the frame! He thinks he's Superman. He gets along fine with other dogs that don't mind exuberant outbursts of the zoomies and likes ear scratchies - though he literally never stops moving, so he would need a patient kind of companion. He is not aggressive towards them; just exuberant. He rides fine in the car and thinks his crate is a home away from home. Snoopy weighs in at about 20 lbs - he's quite a small dude!\n",
      "\n",
      "Snoopy was kept on a runner outside of a trailer for his entire life that we know of. Because of his past background, he is food and treat possessive and is learning how to share. His ideal home would be one where his people understood his need to be fed separately and enjoyed his happy, exuberant energy. Because of his size and no prior health issues, we think Snoopy's approximate lifespan could go anywhere from 15-18 years - he still has a lot of time to love his folks in him!\n",

He is not a fan of the crate and will make this known if anyone tries to leave him in one! He is a good boy and will not tear up anything but will snooze while he waits for you to come home.

      "Hello! My name is Lonnie and I think I would make a great addition to your home! I am a special needs guy because I love my human, I will pick one human to be my special human. I get along with calmer dogs who like to lounge around like me. My favorite thing in the world is to be with my human. I may be a little shy at first, but once I love you, I promise no one else will ever love you more than me because I have a habit of guarding my human from all other people and pets. I love to be pet, snuggle up next to you, and be able to look out a window as the world passes by. I need a home that will not let me guard my person or boss the other pets. My foster mom has worked with me and my foster fur sister, Lily, lets me know when I need to calm down. I have separation anxiety in homes without other pets, so I would be best in a home with another dog or dogs. I am not food aggressive or toy aggressive or too barky. I am house trained and love going on walks and car rides. I would need to meet my future dog sibling, as I tend to coexist best with calm male dogs and can be dog selective. I do not like cats and would not be a good fit with homes that have children, given my person guarding instincts. Lonnie's adoption fee is the donation of the adopters choice. All Pet Central animals are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped (registration included), current on parasite prevention, and come with one month of free pet health insurance. Dogs over seven months of age are heartworm tested. When adopting, we will ensure that you receive copies of veterinary and microchip records.Due to the construction of our state of the art facility, none of our pets are on site, they are all located in foster homes at this time.If you would like to meet this pet, please fill out the brief Adopter Survey (This is your adoption application) : https://petcentralhelps.org/dog-puppy-applicationAfter we review your completed survey we will contact you by phone or email within 72 hours or less (We're primarily a volunteer organization, so we appreciate your patience. Please note- Out of respect for our volunteers and staff, we are closed on Sundays and will not be processing any applications on that day). Do get back to us right away when we call or email regarding an application so that we can quickly connect. A Pet Central representative will then set up an appointment to meet the pet for possible adoption.At the time of the meeting, we would like you to get to know each other by spending a minimum of 15 minutes interacting with your potential family member and chatting with us. You will take your new friend home if all are in agreement that a match has been made.We do ask that you bring a leash or carrier in addition to the adoption fee.We don't accept checks, but do take cash in the exact amount, and debit/credit cards.Thank you for considering a rescue pet!Sincerely,Pet Central\n",

      "UPDATE:  2 years ago, Kelly was adopted into what was supposed to be her forever home. Sadly her adopter was no longer able to care for her and an overweight Kelly was returned to PAWS.  SheÃ¢ÂÂs just as sweet but obviously needs a home that will help her regain her girlish figure.  Kelly is not about 4 years old. \n",
      "Watch out world, here comes Kelly.  Kelly is only 2 years old, absolutely adorable and full of energy, personality and kisses.  Our best guess on breed is exactly that but regardless of heritage, the end result is one little busy butt we're calling Kelly.  If you look closely at her pictures you'll notice that Kelly's eyes are partially blue.  We've no idea where that came from but the blue is certainly there.  Kelly has tested heartworm positive but don't let that be a deterrent when considering adopting her.  Heartworms can be addressed by a simple dose of Heartgard on a monthly basis which keeps more from developing and the adults die off more quickly. \n",
      "Kelly will be vaccinated, spayed and microchipped prior to adoption.  Her adoption fee is $175.\n",
      "PAWS has added the H3N2 flu vaccine to its shot protocol.  Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake.  Depending on how long they're here with us, they may received a second vaccination but if adopted right away, we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\n",
      "To meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297.  We do applications in person or over the phone.  You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.\n",
