This project will analyze the European air routes operated by airlines in the last week of January 2023.
Webscraping techniques and APIs will be used to obtain the data, and data cleaning and data quality operations will be carried out before proceeding with the integration of the datasets.
Finally, the dataset will be imported into MongoDB and queries will be carried out in Pymongo to obtain statistical and economic conclusions.
